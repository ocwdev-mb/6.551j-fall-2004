Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Recitations: 1 session / week, 1 hour / session

Description
-----------

The Acoustics of Speech and Hearing is an H-Level graduate course (4-1-7) that reviews the physical processes involved in the production, propagation and reception of human speech. Particular attention is paid to how the acoustics and mechanics of the speech and auditory system define what sounds we are capable of producing and what sounds we can sense. Areas of discussion include:

1.  the acoustic cues used in determining the direction of a sound source,
2.  the acoustic and mechanical mechanisms involved in speech production and
3.  the acoustic and mechanical mechanism used to transduce and analyze sounds in the ear.

General Information
-------------------

The class meets for two 1.5-hour lectures and one 1-hour recitation session each week with three laboratory sessions scheduled throughout the semester. There is one written assignment each week consisting either of a problem set (8 throughout the term), a lab report (3 throughout the term) or one of two take-home exams, a mid-term and a final.

Grading
-------

20% of the final grade is based on homework and class participation, 20% is based on the three lab reports, 60% is based on the mid-term and final exam. Students are encouraged to seek the help of the teaching assistants and other staff in performing the homeworks.

Who Should Take This Course
---------------------------

The Acoustics of Speech and Hearing course is open to beginning graduate students and upper level undergraduates who have had two semesters of college-level physics (or equivalent) and differential and integral calculus. Past students have included Physics, EE and ME juniors, seniors and graduate students as well as graduate students from the Media Lab.

Text Books
----------

The recommended (but not required) textbook for the course is:

Denes, P. B., and E. N. Pinson. _The Speech Chain: The physics and biology of spoken speech__._ 2nd ed. New York: W. H. Freeman, 1993. ISBN: 9780716722564.

This text is written for non-engineers but it contains a clear basic description of the physiologic and physical processes involved in speech production, transmission, reception and recognition.

Other more detailed and engineering oriented texts will be useful from time:
